<h2><b>A simple Bank Management System implemented using C++</b></h2>

The main objective of this project is to create a banking management system that can do the following functions : 
1.  Create a new account
2.  Deposit money
3.  Withdraw money
4.  View balance
5.  Modify A/c records
6.  Close account

And the following above functionalities are made possible by using the libraries : 
<h4>iostream.h:</h4>
This class inherits all members from its two parent classes istream and ostream, thus being able to perform both input and output operations.

<h4>fstream.h</h4>
Header providing file stream classes

<h4>cctype.h</h4>
This header declares a set of functions to classify and transform individual characters.

<h4>iomanip.h</h4>
Header providing parametric manipulators:

We create a class named account and define methods to interface with the user. 

The outputs can be seen as in the BankMngSys/Outputs folder.
